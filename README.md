<h1>MiTM ATA (All-Things-ARP)</h1>
<p>ATA is a penetration tool for simple usage within a command-line environment. Using this tool, you can intercept network traffic to other devices on your local network and view the packets from
third-party software such as WireShark. This information could be as useful as an email and password or as useless as encrypted TLS / SSL data over HTTPS.</p>
